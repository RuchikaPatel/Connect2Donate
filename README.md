Testing Procedures
Test Objectives
Testing is a crucial element in SDLC as it helps in finding bugs and error during the early stage of software development. Thus, it helps developer to build defect less and error free application that has exceptional performance, quality and effectiveness.
Types of Testing
Following are the type of testing that are used while testing our web application “C2D”.

Unit Testing
The main objective of unit testing is to verify whether every single unit operates as intended or not. For a separate unit, take a function, procedure or method to test. Sometimes, it can even be the whole module of the application. Unit testing can be conducted manually, but here we have done automated testing.
Usability Testing
The main objective is to ensure that we end up having an easy-to-use, intuitive and similar to industry-accepted interfaces which are widely. Moreover, the usability testing process of the Web application is performed to have a quick and easy step application with less functionality than a slow and difficult application with numerous features. Thus, Usability testing is applied to check whether the application is easy to use and understand from the user’s point of view.
Compatibility Testing
The main objective of compatibility is to ensure the application functions well on different browsers by analyzing all aspects of the Website UI, including content visibility, readability, and functionality. Moreover, network compatibility is another important aspect that must be examined during this phase to ensure the website works across different network operators without bugs.
